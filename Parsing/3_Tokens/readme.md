Goal: prepare to parse by turning words to token
nodes, also  check syntax here

By taking each word and creating a token node that has a type and value it makes the syntax check much easier;
We have three types at this stage redir, pipe and word

Need to check for empty strings in the argument
This is the start of moving from array to linked lists;


Areas of work:
Totally untested for now lol
